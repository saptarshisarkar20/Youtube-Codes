# THIS IS HOW TO PRINT IN PYTHON

# JUST USE A 'print()' STATEMENT
# ITS THAT MUCH EASY


print("Hello World!")
# just warp the string to print in double quote
# Lets execute it

print("Hello Python")
# by default print statement executes in the next line .

# if you want to print in the same line use "end=""' in the print statement

print("it is the 1st line ", end="")
print("It is the second line")
# make sure you put a comma unless its an error

# That's all for today
